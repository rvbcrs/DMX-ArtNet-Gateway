/**
 * @brief Emplaces parameter data from a source buffer to a destination buffer.
 * It is necessary to emplace parameter data before it is written and read to
 * ensure it is formatted correctly for the RDM data bus or for the ESP32's
 * memory. Emplacing data swaps the endianness of each parameter field and also
 * optionally writes null terminators for strings and writes optional UID
 * fields.
 *
 * Parameter fields are emplaced using a format string. This provides the
 * instructions on how data is written. Fields are written in the order provided
 * in the format string. The following characters can be used to write parameter
 * data:
 * - 'b' writes an 8-bit byte of data.
 * - 'w' writes a 16-bit word of data.
 * - 'd' writes a 32-bit dword of data.
 * - 'u' writes a 48-bit UID.
 * - 'v' writes an optional 48-bit UID if the UID is not 0000:00000000. Optional
 *   UIDs must be at the end of the format string.
 * - 'a' writes an ASCII string. ASCII strings may be up to 32 characters long
 *   and may or may not be null-terminated. An ASCII string must be at the end
 *   of the format string.
 *
 * Integer literals may be written by beginning the integer with '#' and writing
 * the literal in hexadecimal form. Integer literals must be terminated with an
 * 'h' character. For example, the integer 0xbeef is represented as "#beefh".
 * Integer literals are written regardless of what the underlying value is. This
 * is used for situations such as emplacing a rdm_device_info_t wherein the
 * first two bytes are 0x01 and 0x00.
 *
 * Parameters will continue to be emplaced as long as the number of bytes
 * written does not exceed the size of the destination buffer, as provided in
 * the num argument. A single parameter may be emplaced instead of multiple by
 * including a '$' character at the end of the format string.
 *
 * Null terminators are not used for strings sent on the RDM data bus. When
 * emplacing data onto the RDM data bus, the emplace_nulls argument should be
 * set to false. When emplacing into ESP32 memory to be read by the caller,
 * emplace_nulls should be set to true to ensure that strings are null
 * terminated. Setting emplace_nulls to true will also affect optional UID
 * fields by emplacing a 0000:00000000 into the destination buffer when an
 * optional UID is not present in the source buffer. When emplace_nulls is
 * false, optional UIDs will not be emplaced when its value is 0000:00000000. It
 * is considered good practice to set emplace_nulls to true when the destination
 * buffer is intended to be read by the user, and false when the destination
 * buffer will be sent on the RDM data bus.
 *
 * Example format strings and their corresponding PIDs are included below.
 *
 * RDM_PID_DISC_UNIQUE_BRANCH: "uu$"
 * RDM_PID_DISC_MUTE: "wv$"
