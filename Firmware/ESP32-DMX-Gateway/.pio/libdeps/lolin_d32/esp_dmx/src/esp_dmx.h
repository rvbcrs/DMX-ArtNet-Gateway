 * @brief This is the main header file for esp_dmx. It contains required API
 * functions for the user. Notably, the functions in this header are not
 * hardware-dependent. The functions in this file do not interface with any of
 * the functions described in uart.h, timer.h, or nvs.h. This header includes
 * dmx/hal.h which contains functions that interface with hardware.
